# Data science

## Overview

Data science is the practice of extracting useful insights and predictions from data by combining statistics, programming, and domain knowledge. Typical workflows include framing a problem, collecting and preparing data, building and evaluating models, deploying them to production, and monitoring performance over time.

### Core components

- Problem definition and success metrics
- Data acquisition and exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training, tuning, and evaluation
- Deployment, monitoring, and governance

## Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Science Professional

You’re completing the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Data Science Professional course. This focuses on building, operationalizing, and managing ML solutions on OCI.

### What you’ll practice

- Managed notebooks with OCI Data Science
- Conda environments and reproducibility
- Data flow and feature engineering at scale
- Training with Accelerated Data Science (ADS) SDK
- Experiment tracking, model catalogs, and model evaluation
- Model deployment with OCI Data Science Model Deployment
- MLOps on OCI: pipelines, monitoring, and governance

### Key skills and topics

- Supervised and unsupervised learning fundamentals
- Model selection, cross‑validation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Metrics: classification, regression, and ranking
- Handling imbalance, leakage, and drift
- Responsible AI: fairness, explainability, and privacy
